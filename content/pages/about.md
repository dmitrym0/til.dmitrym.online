This is my TIL ("Today I Learned") compendium. In the spirit of sharing and learning in public. I originally learned this from Sean Willson's [What to blog about](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/6/what-to-blog-about/):

> A TIL—Today I Learned—is the most liberating form of content I know of.
> Did you just learn how to do something? Write about that.
> Call it a TIL—that way you’re not promising anyone a revelation or an in-depth tutorial. You’re saying “I just figured this out: here are my notes, you may find them useful too”.
